# GEICO Class Imbalance Project
 
# Business Problem:
GEICO provides several ways for its policyholders to make payments. While GEICO's service counselors can take payments over the phone, it is more cost-efficient for customers to make payments through their self-service channels such as online or through the automated phone system. Thus, they would like to use a predictive model to select people to receive a pre-emptive e-mail message designed to encourage them to pay online.

# Task at hand:

We have been tasked with identifying which customers are likely to make a service payment call in the next 5 days. The attached file contains data on customers who have had a bill due in the next 5 days and whether they made a service payment call. 

We will construct a model that predicts the likelihood that each policyholder will make a service payment call (CALL_FLAG=1).
